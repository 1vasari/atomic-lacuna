Setup & Usage
=============

###Setup

To get Atomic Lacuna setup, you'll need a few things. All of the following are
required and getting them to run on each different OS is different, so, go to
their websites and figure it out yourself. I know you can do it.

To start with:
- [Git](http://git-scm.com/)
- [NodeJs](http://nodejs.org/)

I'm kidding.. I'm kidding. Git and NodeJs should be really simple. If they're not,
yell at me in a Github issue and we can sort your stuff out.

Now that we've got all that boring stuff outta the way. Let the fun begin:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/atom/atom-shell # Get the atom-shell
git clone https://github.com/Vasari/atomic-lacuna # Get this repository
cd atomic-lacuna
npm install # Get the JavaScript dependencies

# You should be done!

```

###Usage

To run the project, `cd` into the `atomic-lacuna` directory again and run the `run` script.
