Setup & Usage
=============

###Setup

To get Atomic Lacuna setup, you'll need a few things. All of the following are
required and getting them to run on each different OS is different, so, you go to
their websites and figure it out yourself. I know you can do it.

To start with:
- git
- nodejs

I'm kidding.. I'm kidding. Git and NodeJs should be really simple. But atom-shell
doesn't have any instructions. All you do, is clone its repository to the same place
that you're putting Atomic Lacuna in later. Eg, your home folder.

Now that we've got all that boring crap outta that way. Let the fun begin:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/atom/atom-shell # Get the atom-shell
git clone https://github.com/Vasari/atomic-lacuna # Get this repository
cd atomic-lacuna
npm install # Get the JavaScript dependencies

# You should be done!

```

###Usage

To run the project, `cd` into `atomic-lacuna` directory again and, depending on
your operating system, run the `run` script.
