<p>There are several ideas behind this project, a lot of them are aimed at improving
the quality of the code so that improvements can be made to important issues such
as performance or usability.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="implemented"><a href="#implemented" class="anchor"></a>Implemented</h4><ul>
<li>Use JSHint to check the code for errors and report on possible bugs because
of various pitfalls in the JavaScript language design.</li>
<li>Use Browserify to make this code usable in the web browser, so that we&#39;re only
maintaining one code base.</li>
<li>Make zip files for Windows, Linux and the web browser containing the platform-specific
binaries to Run The Thing.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="working-on"><a href="#working-on" class="anchor"></a>Working On</h4><ul>
<li>Use the Handlebars template engine to use HTML templates instead of manually
messing with HTML inside the code. The reasons for this should be obvious.</li>
<li>More jQuery and Underscore, less YUI. The version of YUI that this project uses
has been depreciated since 2011. It&#39;s now 2014. Rely on YUI as little as possible
when writing or improving code. Extra notes about this:<ul>
<li>Don&#39;t use the YAHOO.lacuna global for the code.</li>
<li>There is nearly always a jQuery/Underscore/jQuery plugin which is more concise
than the raw DOM manipulation that goes on right now.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Properly document each of the core library methods so that they make more sense.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="later"><a href="#later" class="anchor"></a>Later</h4><ul>
<li>Because this project is NodeJs based, it&#39;s the easiest thing in the world to
break code out into new modules.</li>
<li>General cleaning of messy code.</li>
</ul>
<p>Other possible improvements that could be done later on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fix all the weird method names that aren&#39;t camelCased. This is really annoying
and generally confusing for people new to the code. This could probably be fixed
earlier rather than later, but because I&#39;m the only person developing this project
and it doesn&#39;t bother me <em>as much</em>, it&#39;s being delayed.</li>
