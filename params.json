All the documentation for\r\nthis is viewable on the [documentation index page](https://github.com/Vasari/atomic-lacuna/blob/master/docs/index.md).\r\nIf you have any questions or suggestions, please yell at me via the Github Issue tracker.\r\nI'd love to hear from you. :blush:\r\n\r\nWhy? :octocat:\r\n====\r\n\r\nI've been wanting to try and add cool new stuff to the Lacuna Web Client for\r\nquite some time now, however, my plans have been foiled by the inability to load\r\nmore JavaScript into the page (Underscore or jQuery to name a few). This was\r\nbecause the `index.html` couldn't be changed and I didn't want to be inserting\r\n`<script>` elements onto the page at runtime ('cause that's ugly, man).\r\n\r\nI came across [Atom](atom.io) some time ago, however I never really looked into it.\r\nRecently I tried to build it on my system and I discovered that it ran on a 'shell'\r\nthat could be re-used in other projects.\r\n\r\nTo make a short story shorter, the `atom-shell` allows a web page (such as the\r\nweb client) to run in a desktop window and have access to the file system via\r\nNodeJs. This allowed me to streamline the loading of all the JavaScript and assets.\r\nI don't have any performance tests, but the client *seems* faster in the desktop\r\nmode than in the web browser. If any of that doesn't convince you, just look at it.\r\nNo silly web browser rubbish in the way! Tadaaa! :dizzy:\r\n\r\n![Atomic Lacuna in action!](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Vasari/atomic-lacuna/master/docs/Screenshot.png)\r\nMade with :heart: by Nathan McCallum and contributers under the MIT license! :panda_face:\r\n\r\nBadges! :beginner:\r\n=======\r\n\r\n| Name             | Status    |\r\n| :--------------: | :-------: |\r\n| Code Climate     | [![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/Vasari/atomic-lacuna.png)](https://codeclimate.com/github/Vasari/atomic-lacuna) |\r\n| Travis CI        | [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Vasari/atomic-lacuna.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Vasari/atomic-lacuna)     |\r\n| Ohloh            | [![Ohloh](https://www.ohloh.net/images/logo/ohloh_hub.png)](https://www.ohloh.net/p/atomic-lacuna)\r\n| Dependencies     | [![Dependency Status](https://david-dm.org/Vasari/atomic-lacuna.svg)](https://david-dm.org/Vasari/atomic-lacuna) |\r\n| Dev Dependencies | [![Dev Dependency Status](https://david-dm.org/Vasari/atomic-lacuna/dev-status.svg)](https://david-dm.org/Vasari/atomic-lacuna#info=devDependencies) |\r\n\r\nChanges\r\n=======\r\n\r\n###0.1.2 (Unreleased)\r\n- Cleaned all of the code out using `node-beautify`.\r\n- Fixed some errors introduced in the cleaning.\r\n- Implemented a build for the web browser.\r\n\r\n###0.1.1 (2014-07-13)\r\n- Include binaries for Windows (32 bit) and Linux (64 and 32 bit).\r\n\r\n###0.1.0 (2014-07-13)\r\n- Started keeping a change log.\r\n- Sorted out the inclusion of `node_modules` in linux builds.\r\n- The build script now zips each package.\r\n- Build script now deletes old stuff before running.\r\n- Ignore useless development dependencies when building.\r\n\r\n###0.0.1\r\n- Initial version! :D\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
